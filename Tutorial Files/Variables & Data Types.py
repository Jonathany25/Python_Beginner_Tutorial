# There are four main data types in python: integers, float, string, boolean
# Variables are created by typing <variable_Name> = <value>

number = 10
# This is an integer, it is a whole number

decimal = 10.0
# This is an float, it is a decimal

word = "10"
# This is a string, strings are dictated by using quotation marks as seen above

# Even though these three may appear to pproduce similar values,
# their usages in programming are different as will be seen in the future

boolean = True
# This is a boolean, it is a True or False value, which has to follow exact formatting
# where T and F are capital

# Variable can also be printed like normal text by specifying the variable name instead of text
# such as shown below

print(number)
print(decimal)
print(word)
print(boolean)
