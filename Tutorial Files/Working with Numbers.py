from math import *

# import adds external code for you to use
# this is saying to import code from python math for you to use
# there are many other modules to be accessed which you can check out

x = 5
z = -5
# integer value

a = 4.5
# float value

print(10 % 3)
# division but instead of giving out the quotient it gives the remainder, called modulus
# this will return 1

y = str(x)
# str() changer integer to string
# When printing number next to string, number needs to also be a string

print("The number is " + y)
# This will not return an error
# print("The number is " + x) would return an error as one is string and the other is an integer

print(abs(z))
# returns absolute value

print(pow(2, 4))
# calculate first number to the power of second number, so this would return 16

print(max(1, 6))
# returns larger number, min() returns lower number

print(round(a))
# rounds off number up and down

# from python maths

print(floor(a))
# rounds down, ceil() rounds up

print(sqrt(25))
# gets square root of number
